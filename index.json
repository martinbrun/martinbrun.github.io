When information to assess this is limited, individuals can only infer about it. Do people engage in this process? Are they accurate? In this project, we investigate if people think about this and if it affects inequality acceptance. We design a theory-driven experiment that isolates self-interest considerations, capturing individual moral acceptability of inequalities. We will elicit fairness preferences and beliefs about choices in equal-opportunity counterfactual scenarios. We will explore if those beliefs are biased by the observed unequal circumstances and if that affects moral decisions. We will test if people demand better information to decide and if thinking about counterfactual scenarios impacts their decisions. Our findings will shed light on behavioral underpinnings for the incomplete pass-through of unequal opportunities aknowledgement to fairness judgments.","tags":[],"title":"Counterfactual thinking and inequality acceptance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Brun","Xavier Ramos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"728c5b4047c374feead4a6797c2256c6","permalink":"https://example.com/research/2024_chapter4/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2024_chapter4/","section":"research","summary":"This paper measures how social identity affects preferences for redistribution.

These responses enhanced national identity. I exploit the occurrence of terrorist attacks during fieldwork of the public opinion surveys and find that individuals surveyed after major terrorist attacks feel more connected to others in their country. This increase is met with higher preferences for redistribution.

We will leverage the ‘Write your own adventure’ exercise in the initial level of CT and randomly assigned classes to one of four different representations of accomplished scientists. These biographies will focus on (i) either a male or female scientist, who (ii) either succeeded when young or overcame early academic struggles. We will assess the impact on children’s interest in STEM across biographies. Finally, we will shed light on the underlying mechanisms by analyzing how children gender stereotypes and norms, and growth mindset change when exposed to different role models.

We link preferences to previously-measured cognition, and find that high-cognition individuals are 35% more likely to always support such schemes. These preferences are not driven by scheme convenience nor vaccine hesitancy, but appear to be caused by prosociality. We argue that this latter is linked to the perception of less equality of opportunity in society: despite having similar ideals about the role that effort and luck should play in life, high-cognition individuals perceive outcomes to be more determined by luck.","tags":null,"title":"After you.

But it is not clear how their political preferences regarding redistribution play out, as they tend to be richer and more pro-social. We asses empirically this question by exploiting two cohort studies from the United Kingdom that measure cognitive ability during childhood and preferences during adulthood. We find that the top 10% most able individuals are more supportive for redistribution, even without controlling for their higher income. By controlling for a rich set of variables, we unveil a partial positive effect of 10.7 p.p. that prevails over negative ones. This effect appears to be focused on individuals that have volunteered in organizations, suggesting that social motives may be a consequential factor for this pivotal group of individuals.","tags":null,"title":"Redistributive Preferences in High-Cognition Individuals","type":"research"},{"authors":["Martin Brun","Juan Pedro Gambetta","Gonzalo J.

We document this asymmetric response using macro-level data for Pakistan and show that export adjustments after depreciations are less than one-third as fast as those to appreciations. We use product-destination level data to examine three complementary drivers of this asymmetry: (i) information frictions that increase the search costs of finding new clients; (ii) supply constraints related limited access to credit that reduce exporters’ capacity to scale up after relative prices become more favorable; and (iii) reduced prices in US dollars offered by international buyers after local currency depreciations, akin to a pricing-to-market mechanism. We find evidence of the three drivers explaining the dampened export response to depreciations.

How much attention do researchers give to poverty and inequality? What is the focus of research on these issues? The paper aims to analyse the main patterns of academic publications on poverty and inequality in Latin America. A bibliometric analysis based on different sources is used to review the main trends of publications on poverty and inequality in the region between 1990 and 2014. We find that although Latin America is widely recognized as one of the most unequal regions worldwide, poverty—not inequality—has been at the center of the region’s research agendas for many years. We detect a gradual shift in research from poverty to inequality, both in the academic literature and in the publications of international organizations. These findings provide new elements to better understand how and why researchers choose certain topics over others. This understanding is important both to gain knowledge on what researchers are prioritizing, and to shed light on the relationship between those priorities and public policies to combat poverty and inequality.","tags":null,"title":"Poverty and inequality in Latin America's research agenda: A bibliometric review","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

On the basis of household survey data, we analyze their coverage, importance in household income, and effects on poverty reduction and income redistribution. We present a static microsimulation to analyze the potential impacts of alternative program designs, including perfect targeting and higher budgets. Our results illustrate wide variation in terms of design, coverage, and importance in household income. CTs account for a significant portion of household income in lower deciles. Nonetheless, their effects in terms of reducing the incidence, intensity, and severity of poverty are moderate at best, and although their progressivity is high, their redistributive impact is limited. These results are mainly explained by the meager resources involved. Even under perfect targeting, the budgets allocated would be insufficient to achieve full coverage among households in the lowest part of the income distribution.","tags":null,"title":"Cash transfers in Latin America: Effects on poverty and redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Brun","Andrés Rius"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"3e9189cceccbe923f87f82403bb23746","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2016_investment/","publishdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_investment/","section":"publication","summary":"The lack of agreement between empirically-based works and theorization could be a consequence of the application of assumptions and methodologies which are not entirely suitable to understand some conditions about the studied phenomenon. In this study we face the challenge from a different perspective, using the unusual but highly suitable tools from qualitative comparison analysis developed by Ragin (2008). We center on the study of the presence or absence of sets of conditions that prompted investment booms between 1970 and 2012 in 11 Latin American countries. The technique allows us to confirm that the presence or absence of certain conditions is important when studying the relevance of the remaining ones.","tags":null,"title":"La Lógica de los Auges de Inversión","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
