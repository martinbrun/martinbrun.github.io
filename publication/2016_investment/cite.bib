    abstract = {The lack of agreement between empirically-based works and theorization about investment could be a consequence of the application of assumptions and methodologies which are not entirely suitable to understand some conditions about the studied phenomenon. In this study we face the challenge from a different perspective, using the unusual but highly suitable tools from qualitative comparison analysis developed by Ragin (2008). We center on the study of the presence or absence of sets of conditions that prompted investment booms between 1970 and 2012 in 11 Latin American countries. The technique allows us to confirm that the presence or absence of certain conditions is important when studying the relevance of the remaining ones. }
